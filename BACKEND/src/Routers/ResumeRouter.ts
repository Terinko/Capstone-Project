I will provide skills and tasks learned, grouped by university course.
Transform these into strong, action-oriented resume bullet points, grouped by course.

${classBlocks}

Requirements:
1. Output each course as a labeled section header using only alphabetical and numeric characters and a colon (e.g., "SER-491:").
2. Under each course, list 2-4 bullet points using strong action verbs (e.g., Engineered, Orchestrated, Developed).
3. Consolidate related skills within the same course where appropriate.
4. Do not include any markdown formatting.
5. Return plain text only, with course headers followed by bullet points on new lines.

const buildTalkingPointsPrompt = (
  classBlocks: string,
) => `Act as a technical interview coach.

I will provide skills and tasks learned, grouped by university course.
Transform them into interview-ready talking points that a student can say out loud.

${classBlocks}

Requirements:
1. Output each course as a labeled section header using only alphabetical and numeric characters and a colon (e.g., "SER-491:").
2. For each skill provided, generate EXACTLY ONE talking point.
3. Do NOT combine skills together.
4. Do NOT create multiple talking points for a single skill.
5. Each talking point must be on its own new line and begin with a dash (-).
6. Write each talking point in first-person language (e.g., "I built...", "I implemented...", "I worked with...").
7. Each talking point should:
   - Clearly explain what was done
   - Reference tools, technologies, or concepts when possible
   - Sound natural for an interview response
8. Keep each talking point concise (1-2 sentences max).
9. Do not include markdown formatting.
10. Return plain text only.

Strict Rule:
- If a course has N skills listed, you must return exactly N talking points for that course.
- Maintain a one-to-one mapping between input skills and output talking points.
